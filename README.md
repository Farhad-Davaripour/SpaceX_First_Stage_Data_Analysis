### Overview  
* * *

SpaceX is a well-known private company famous for several historic milestones in launching rockets and successfully returning the first stage. This capability enabled SpaceX to advertise the Falcon 9 rocket with the price of $62 million which is more than 60% cheaper that the other competitive companies.  

Due to the importance of successful first stage landing, the present work uses Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the outcome of the first stage landing.  

The present lab is a part of [Applied Data Science Capstone Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) offered by [Coursera.org](https://www.Coursera.org)

The extracts launch data from SpaceX REST API and employs classification algorithms to predict the first stage of the launch for Falcon 9. The list of contents in the [notebook](https://github.com/Farhad-Davaripour/SpaceX_First_Stage_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Notebook.ipynb) includes:

* Loading Data
* Data Preparation
* Data extraction from API
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory data analysis
* Visualization
* Dashboarding
* Machine learning Models
* Conclusion

The launch data is also extracted separately from [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches&oldid=1027686922) web page. The notebook is provided in the link below:
